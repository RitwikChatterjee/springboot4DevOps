SpringBoot 4 DevOps



This is a simple application I have created during the DevOps project based on SpringBoot.



**Main branches**

* **master**
  * Code to run on SpringBoot standalone
* **tomcatDeploy**
  * Code to run the application as a war file on standalone Tomcat Server
    * Has the necessary POM file dependency to pack as a WAR file for tomcat server
